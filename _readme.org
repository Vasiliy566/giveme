* Giveme: dependency injection for python

Giveme is a general purpose dependency injector for python, heavily inspired pytest's fixtures.  
Use it to inject databases, API clients, framework pieces or anything else that you don't want tightly coupled
to your code.  

* Install

Python3.4 and up are supported  
~pip install giveme~

* Usage

** Quickstart

Here we use giveme to inject a random animal into a function.  

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session examples :results output :exports both
import random

from giveme import register, inject


def random_animal_factory():
    animals = ['duck', 'goose', 'horse', 'tiger', 'cow', 'sheep', 'pig']
    return random.choice(animals)


@register
def animal():
    return random_animal_factory()


@inject
def print_animal(animal=None): 
    print("It's a", animal)


print_animal()
print_animal()
print_animal()

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: It's a duck
: It's a horse
: It's a tiger

By default the ~animal~ function is called each time it's injected. 
In this case, each time ~print_animal~ is called.  

We can also inject the animal factory itself:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session examples :results output :exports both
@register
def animal_factory():
    return random_animal_factory


@inject
def print_animal(animal_factory=None): 
    print("It's a", animal_factory())


print_animal()
print_animal()
print_animal()

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: It's a duck
: It's a horse
: It's a cow


** Singleton and threadlocal dependencies

You may want only one instance of something throughout the lifetime 
of your application, or one instance per thread.  
~@register~ accepts the keyword arguments ~singleton~ and ~threadlocal~ to support this.  


#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session examples :results output :exports both
@register(singleton=True)
def animal():
    return random_animal_factory()


@inject
def print_animal(animal=None): 
    print("It's a", animal)


print_animal()
print_animal()
print_animal()

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: It's a pig
: It's a pig
: It's a pig

Now ~animal~ is only called once and every function that injects it gets the same animal.  
~@register(threadlocal=True)~ works the same way, except the animal instance is only available to the thread that created it.  

** Override dependencies

Injected dependencies can always be overridden by passing a value manually. Great for testing!

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session examples :results output :exports both
@inject
def print_animal(animal=None): 
    print("It's a", animal)


print_animal()
# Manual override, must use the named argument explictly
print_animal(animal='snake')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: It's a pig
: It's a snake
